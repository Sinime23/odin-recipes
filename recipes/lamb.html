            <li>    1/2 tsp freshly ground black peppe</li>
            <li>    8 lamb chop</li>

        <h3>The method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using paper towels, pat dry chops and discard any shards or bone fragments.</li>
            <li>Mix all of the ingredients together in a small jug or bowl. </li>
            <li>Arrange lamb chops in a large baking dish or on a large plate, and pour the marinade all over the lamb, rubbing it into the meat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate for half an hour, or for a deeper flavour, marinate overnight in the refrigerator, turning the chops from time to time (before cooking, let lamb chops sit at room temp 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan (cast iron preferably or grill plates) over high heat until just starting to smoke. Fry or grill lamb in 2 batches for 3-4 minutes each side, depending on thickness until done to your liking. (Usually, at 3 minutes per side they are medium, and at 4 minutes they are medium-well.)</li>
            <li>Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
                Sprinkle with a little extra dried oregano for added flavour and a little extra lemon juice (optional)</li>
        </ol>
